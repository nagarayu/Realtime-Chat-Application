# Real-Time Chat Application :
Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application! This app allows users to engage in group chats without the need for a login ID. It uses session storage for chat data, ensuring that all conversations are deleted once all participants leave the group, thereby maintaining privacy.

## Features

- Anonymous Group Chats: No need to log inâ€”simply join a group and start 
  chatting.
- Session Storage: Chat data is stored temporarily using session storage and - is automatically deleted when the group session ends.
- Privacy First: No database storage, ensuring that your conversations 
   remain - private and are not saved permanently.
- Easy to Use: Intuitive user interface, allowing users to join and leave 
  group chats seamlessly.

 ## How It Works
-Join a Chat Group: Users can join existing chat groups or create new ones 
 based on their interests.
- Real-Time Messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly within the 
 group using Socket.io.
- Session-Based Storage: The chat history is stored in the session and is 
 deleted once all participants leave, ensuring no data is saved permanently.
